# Python-Projects-forTCS
Examples of Python projects I worked on with students at theCoderSchool along with teaching comments and notes. This example is my own code and own comments. Student versions would vary depending on how advanced the student was and how independently they worked on the project.
<b>This project is something I used for teaching. Some parts of the code are not optimized or organized for the sake of being clearer for younger students who are still learning the basics of coding </b>

## TICTACTOE PYTHON NOTES
Many comments were left in the code. Students wrote the code in trinket.io (online code editor) that allowed them to easily run their code and work with Turtle in Python. Primarily focused toward older students with a strong grasp of Python, functions, arrays, booleans, loops

Example with trinket.io published [here](https://cath-ee-lin-1824.trinket.io/sites/tcstictactoe) (NOTE: this version does not include ties)

Project focuses on review of:
<ul>
  <li>While loops</li>
  <li>1D and 2D arrays</li>
  <li>Nested for loops</li>
  <li>Boolean logic</li>
  <li>Separating code into functions</li>
  <li>Receiving and processing user input</li>
  <li>Clear code documentation</li>
  <li>Some math concepts such as degrees and very basic geometry</li>
</ul>

Project introduces concepts of:
<ul>
  <li>Multidimensional arrays</li>
  <li>Using Python Turtle</li>
  <li>How to Use API Documentation for Python</li>
  <li>Reusable Code</li>
  <li>Testing Code Thoroughly</li>
  <li>Dealing with incorrect user inputs</li>
</ul>

Parts of the code that would vary from student to student would often be the drawing of the board, whether the game declares ties, code resuability, etc

One of the most important aspects of this project is getting students familiarized with Turtle which many have not used before. I strongly encouraged all of my students to Google 'Python 2.7 Turtle documentation" every single time they had a question regarding what function to use for Turtle (how to change direction? how to change position? how to change the color of the turtle?) instead of giving them the answer. This encourages them to Google answers and make use of one of the most valuable resources: documentation. Even better, the documentation for Turtle is very simple and easy to read. By the end of the project, students are able to access documentation and understand how to look for a certain function and use that function in their code.
